# JWT authentication using Node.js
Here I have implemented Json web token from node.js, in this short project there are two implemented methods and those are: <br />
- SignUp <br />
- Login <br />
<br />
# To run this code <br />
- First clone the repository <br />
```
git clone https://github.com/priyanshudubey/JWT-authentication.git <br />
```
- Then <br />

```
npm install <br />
```
- And finally <br />
```
npm start or node app.js <br />
```
Now your app is running on `http://localhost:5000/` <br />
